Browser specific utilities like lauching native applicaitons from a browser.

## Usage


## Testing

To run both unit and integration tests open command line at the project level and run:

    npm test

### Manual Testing
Open a command line and navigate to where the code was checked out to.
Run:

    npm install
    npm run start

This will start a web sever that you can use to manually run and test the application. You'll need a valid HTML page to load in the browser (one like demo/index.html in the template project).

### Unit

#### Writing
Tests are writen using Jasmine.

To unit test, add unit tests to the test/unit folder. [See here](https://dev.trapsoft.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CORE3&title=Web+Components+-+Project+Folder+Structure) for project structure details and guides.

Look at the [example](https://svn.trapsoft.com/product/WebUI/CoreWU/trunk/core-wc-template/test/unit) project for examples.

#### Running

Karma is used to run the unit tests. By default the tests are run against a headless Chrome.
To run unit tests open command line at the project level and run:

    npm test:unit

After the tests are complete the unit test runner stays active and watches for changes to files. If a file is modified (source or test file) the tests for the effected file are rerun interactively.

To debug the tests open a browser and point it to http://localhost:9876/. You can place 'debugger' statements in your code and they should break point if you have a browser open and pointing to http://localhost:9876/ whilst the test runner is running.

Enter ctrl + C to quit the test runner.

### Interactive mode

VS Code has extentions that can be used to provide interactive linting. One of such is ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
