# Editing Themes

## Making changes
To make changes to the site settings edit the src/themes/{theme name}/globals/site.variables. Use the site.variables from the default theme as a reference.

## Building changes
Changes should automatically build as part of the npm publish step. But if you want to build them manually for testing then run:

    npm build

This will build all themes.

Or you can erform the process manually as below:

Once changes have been made then run you can perform a build.
Run the gulp build command for each theme you want to build.
To build the default theme (theme-default.config):

    gulp build

To build a specific theme pass the theme param with the name of the themes config file:

    gulp build --theme=theme-dark.config

To run multiple you can chain them:

    gulp build && gulp build --theme=theme-dark.config

## Reviewing changes
In this app, the default view component is a style guide that contains most of the various UI components we use.
Openning this component in a browser should give a quick litmus test as to the impact of any changes.

- ng serve
- Go to [localhost:4201](http://localhost:4201) in a browser

## Publish new CSS
Once happy with changes (and they've been checked into source control) you'll want to publish your changes to NPM.
- cd semantic
- upgrade the package version
-- npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"
-- npm version minor -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"
-- npm version major -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"
- npm publish
